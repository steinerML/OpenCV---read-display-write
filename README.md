Read, Display and Write an Image using OpenCV
## Contents:

Reading, displaying, and writing images are basic to image processing and computer vision.  Even when cropping, resizing, rotating, or applying different filters to process images, you’ll need to first read in the images. So it’s important that you master these basic operations.

OpenCV, the largest computer vision library in the world has these three built-in functions, let’s find out what exactly each one does:

| Function     |Action                                     |
|-------------:|-------------------------------------------|
|     imread() |   helps us read an image                  |
|     imshow() |   displays an image in a window           |
|     imwrite()|  writes an image into the file directory  |
